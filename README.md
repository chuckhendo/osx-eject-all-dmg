osx-eject-all-dmg
=================

Simple BASH script to eject all mounted DMGs. Works with [Terminal Notifier](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier)

Just run ./ejectAllDMG.sh to run. Can be symlinked to a folder in your path to work from any folder. Something like this should work: 

```
ln -s ~/ejectAllDMG.sh /usr/local/bin/ejectDMG
```
